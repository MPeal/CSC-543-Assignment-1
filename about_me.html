<div class="about">
<p>
	Mike's experience in computer science is woefully lacking, but please forgive him:  he's only been pursuing a career in the field for less than four months!
</p>

<p>
	Mike's experience in computer and web programming dates all the way back to fourth grade, where he first learned HTML and how to build a website using the now-ancient Expage.com.</p>
	<p>
	<div class="italic">**Perhaps not coincidentally, it was during this same time nine-year-old Mike learned the hard way that Expage.com and Expages.com were VERY different websites.**</div>
	</p>
</p>

<p>
Eight years later, Mike took a computer programming course in high school and immediately developed a knack for creating programs with C++ Visual Basic.
</p>

<p>
Believe it or not, that encompassed the entirety of Mike's computer science background until mid-2016 (more on that below).
</p>
	
</p>
	<p>
	Prior to making his switch to software development, Mike was a TV sports anchor and reporter for WBNG-TV -- the local CBS affiliate in Binghamton, NY.
	Here, Mike covered everything from record-breaking high school football teams to NASCAR to minor league baseball.
	Along the way, he earned an award for "Best Sportscast" from the New York State Broadcasters Assocation in 2014 for his coverage of  
	Maine-Endwell High School's fourth consecutive state football championship run -- that aforementioned record-breaking football team.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	His fondest memory of Binghamton is getting to tell the story of Sidney High School tennis player Andrew Burpoe, which can be found on <a href="C:\Users\Mike\Desktop\Web Programming Project 1\projects.html">this page</a>.  Mike's laundry list of human-interest feature stories also includes features on a one-legged cancer survivor turned obstacle course runner/inspiring dad, an experiment in the game known as "Foot Golf" and plenty more.
	</p>
	<p>
	Before moving to upstate New York, Mike spent over two years working for upstart local news website It's Relevant, which started in Stamford, CT and branched out into neighboring towns around Fairfield County.  Here, Mike covered literally anything in Stamford:  sports, politics, education, government...the full nine yards for a local reporter.  Later, he moved up I-95 as the lead reporter in Norwalk.  Here, Mike was tasked with cultivating an entire city's worth of sources as a "one-man band reporter."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	That's right, a lone reporter, then just 24-years old, was left with the task of singlehandedly covering all the goings-on of a city with over 85,000 people living in it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<div class="boldItalic">And then you wonder why he quit journalism, right?</div>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	True to his Connecticut roots, Mike graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2011 with a bachelors degree in journalism.  He is working toward completing a masters degree in computer science at Southern Connecticut State University by May 2018.  He currently resides in Hamden, CT.
